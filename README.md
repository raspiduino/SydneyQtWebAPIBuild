# Prebuilt binary of `webapi` in SydneyQt

These binaries are built from https://github.com/juzeon/SydneyQt/tree/v2/webapi, commit `807a4d504b6beb76a8454aa9cdb4259b034734d6`.

For Windows, the binary works right away.
For Linux, please install `musl` if it does not come by default in your distro. For example, in Debian/Ubuntu please do `sudo apt-get install musl`.
For MacOS, I have no Mac devices so I'm not sure. You can try and report in this repo.

Aside from the binary, you are expected to provide a `cookies.json` for proper server function.
